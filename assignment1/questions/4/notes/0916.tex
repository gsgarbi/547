composition of functions
f is epis/f MEASURABLE and g is F/G mesuarble
then gof is epis/g measurable

exercise. prove that.

borel exomorphism:
generalize borel to more general cases

everthing for
(R, B(R))
works for
others

3.2 check mesurability in a generating collection is OK for measurability

3.3 Numerical functions

3.4 f is \epsilon measurable iff for all r in R, f^-1[-inf, r] in epsilon

 a \vii b = max(a,b)
 aAb = min(a,b)
 
positive part
negative part
f^+ >  0
f^- > 0 too
f = f^+  -  f^-

limit of measurable fns. is it measurable? YES
lim inf, lim sup
all pointwise
one inf for each x

1 inf_n f_n: inf f_n)(x) = inf_n f_n(x)
3 lim
(PIC)


fn incre. f_1 <= f_2   point-wise inequality
(f: E -> R)


MAIN IMPORTANT RESULT:
SEQUENCE OF epis eps, then infs, sups, lim inf, lim sup are eps-measurable.


consctruct squence with the known limit and manipulate it.
