(2a)

For each $ A \in \borel(\R) $, in order for X to be a random variable, we need $X^{-1} A \in \sigAlg$.

What must be true of the relationship between $\cal{C}$ and $\sigAlg$?\\
$ \cal{C} \subset \sigAlg $

What must be true of X on each member of $\calC$?\\
X needs to be constant on each element of $\calC$.
