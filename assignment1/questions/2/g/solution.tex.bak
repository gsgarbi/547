f is constant on each member of the partition $\Rightarrow f \ is \ \emeas$:

Prop. 2.3 from book, for the above, it's necessary and sufficient that there exists a $B_0$ that generates $\BR$ such that:
$ f^{-1} B \in B_0 \forall B \in B_0 $

Let's use $B_0$ as the collection of sets of the form $(q, \infty)$. We know, from the previous question, that $B_0$ generates $\BR$.

For each set of the form (q, inf), the inverse image of f will be:

$\{x \in UC_k \forall k : f(C_k) > q\}$.

Since sigalg E is the collection of countable unions of C, we have that $f^-1 B in E for all B in B_0$.


$f \ is \ \emeas$ then f is constant on each member of the partition :

Assume f is not constant in at least one member S in ${C1, C2, ...$. This means there is $x1 != x2 in S such that y1 = f(x1) != f(x2) = y2$.

Then take B = (q-y1, \inf). f^-1 B is all x in E such that f(x) = y1. x is not in any other set of C (pairwise intersection is empty), but at the same time is not there whole S
