Define a probability measure $P_n$ on $(C_n, \calC_n)$.

Let $P_n(A) = \frac{\mu_n(A)}{\mu_n(C_n)}$. Now we have all the requirements for a \textbf{probability measure} as long as this is well defined, i.e, $\mu_n(C_n) \neq 0$

(Ie., we have the requirements for a measure, but now we also have: 
$
P_n(C_n) =
\frac{\mu_n(C_n)}{\mu_n(C_n)} =
1
$)
