%%%%%%%%%%%% SOLUTION %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Let $ \K = \deffK $

I will show: $\K = \sD $.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
$ \K $ is a \sa:
\\
$ E \in \K: $
\\
$E = \union \subset \K$ since D is a partition of E.
\\
\\
\textbf{$\K$ is closed under union:}
\\
$ A \cup B \in \K $ 
\\
$ A \cup C \in \K $ 
\\
$ A \cup (B \cup C) \in \K $
\\
etc.\\
Any union of 2 elements $\in \K$. 

\textbf{$\K$ is closed under complement:}
\\
Since $E = \union $ and $\emptyset = A \cap B = A \cap C = B \cap C$:
\\
$\comp{A} = B \cup C $ 
\\
$\comp{B} = A \cup C $
\\
$\comp{A} = A \cup B $
\\
$\comp{\union} = \emptyset $
\\
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
$D \subset \K$:
\\
$A, B, C \in \K$
\\
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
$ \sD \subset \K $:
\\
$ \K $ is a \sa that contains D, so $ \sD \subset K $
\\
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
$ \K \subset \sD $
\\
$A, B, C \in \sD $ by definition of $\sD$.
\\
$A \cup B, 
A \cup C, 
B \cup C,
\union \in sD $ because $\sD$ is a \sa and, thus, needs to be closed under countable unions.
Therefore, all elements of $\K$ are elements of $\sD$.
