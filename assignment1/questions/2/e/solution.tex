$ 
P(A) = 
P( \cunion[n] (A \cap C_n)) = \text{ (countable additivity as the $A \cap C_n$ are pairwise disjoint) }
\csum P(A \cap C_n) =
\csum P(C_n)\hat{P}_n(A) =
\csum c_n\hat{P}_n(A)
$
, where $ (c_n)_{n \geq 1} = P(C_n)$.\\

Show convexity:

$
\csum c_n 
= 
\csum P(C_n) 
= 
P(\cunion C_n)
=
P(E)
=
1
$
(using that P is a probability measure)

Also, notice $ 0 = P(\emptyset) \leq c_n \leq P(\Omega) = 1 \ \forall n\geq1$.

\textbf{Therefore, P can be recovered as a mixture of the set $\{\hat{P}_n\}_{n \geq 1}$}
