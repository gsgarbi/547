Notation: $ C = \cal{C} $

C is a countable partition of E. Let S be the collection of all sets that are countable unions of elements in C ($C_i$'s, $\emptyset$ included).

Will show $ S = \s{C} $

Proof template:\\
- S is a \sa.\\
- $ \s{C} \subset S $\\
- $ S \subset \s{C} $\\

Lemma: The union of a countable collection of countable sets is countable.

$E \in S$: \\
$C = \{C_1, C2, ... \}$ is a countable partition of E 
$\Rightarrow$
$E = \bigcup C_i \in S $

S is closed under countable unions: \\
The union of a countable collection of countable sets is countable and S is the collection of all sets that are countable unions of elements from C. So any countable union of elements in S will again be a countable union of elements from C, i.e, an element of S.

S is closed under complement: \\
Any A from S can be written as a countable union of a collection of elements in $C^* \subset C_i$'s. $A^c$ is then the union of the $ C_i $'s not in $C^*$ because C is a partition of E. Therefore, by our lemma, $A^c$ is also a countable union of elements from C and hence is also in S.

$ \s{C} \subset S $:
\\
$\s{C}$ is the intersection of all \sa containing C. S is one of those \sa, so $ \s{C} \subset S $

$ S \subset \s{C} $:
\\
By definition, $\s{C}$ needs to be closed under countable union, so it has to contain C and own ($\owns$) all possible countable unions of elements taken from C. So, by the definition of S, $S \subset \s{C}$.

$ \s{C} \subset S \land S \subset \s{C} \iff  S = \s{C} $ \qed
