b)
Let C be a countable partition of E. 
Show that every element of $\s{C}$ is a countable union of elements taken from C. 
Hint: Let S be the collection of all sets that are countable unions of elements taken from C. 
Show that S is a \sa and argue that $ S = \s{C} $
Hint: You might find it useful to recall the fact that the union of a countable collection of sets, each
of which is countable, is again countable.
