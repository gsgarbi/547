Let K be the set of all possible countable unions of A, B and C, i.e:

$ \K = $
$\deffK $

I will show $\K \subset \sD, \sD \subset \K$. Hence, $\K = \sD$.

$ \K $ is a \sa:
\\
$ E \in \K: $
\\
$E = \union \in \K$ since D is a partition of E.
\\
\\
$\K$ is closed under union:
\\
By construction, K closed under union (finite/countable union)
\\ \\
$\K$ is closed under complement:
\\
Since $E = \union $ and $\emptyset = A \cap B = A \cap C = B \cap C$:
\\
$\comp{A} = B \cup C $  \\
$\comp{B} = A \cup C $ \\
$\comp{C} = A \cup B $ \\
$\comp{\union} = \emptyset $ \\
\\
$D \subset \K$: \\
$A, B, C \in \K$
\\ \\
$ \sD \subset \K $: \\
$ \K $ is a \sa that contains D, so $ \sD \subset K$
\\ \\
$\K \subset  \sD:$
\\
$A, B, C \in \sD $ by definition of $\sD$.
\\
$A \cup B, A \cup C, B \cup C, \union \in sD $ because $\sD$ is a \sa and, thus, needs to be closed under countable unions.
Therefore, all elements of $\K$ are elements of $\sD$.
\\ \\
\textbf{Hence, the list of elements in $\s{D}$ are:
\\
$\deffK$}, where $E = \union $
